# React Vending Machine App


This project demonstrate proficiency with React and REST APIs by building a dynamic user-interface consuming a REST API (maintained by The Software Guild).

# The application demonstrats an understanding of:

• Designing a front-end web applications with React

• Component design

• Parent-child tree structure of components

• Use of class and state properties

# The Application has the following features:

• Displaying Items - all items are populated using a REST API request and created dynamically from that call.

• Adding Money - money is incremented by interacting with the 'Add $' buttons in the first form on the right hand side of the application.

• Purchasing Items - after adding money and selecting an item, this submits a purchase to the REST API and display the response results.

• Change Return - when the user purchases an item  the change is displayed automatically in the input field and then the user can  press the return change button    to simulate that they have collected the change, the return change button also clears the input fields of the form.











This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
