# Flooring Mastery

The goal of this mastery project was to create an application that can read, write, update and delete flooring orders.
Please see the UML Class Diagrams and Flow Chart for an abstract view of the application.

# The Application demonsteates an understanding of: #

• MVC architecture, including the use of a service layer

• Interfaces

• Spring dependency Injection

• Unit Testing

• Money handling using BigDecimal

# The application can: #

• Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete orders.

• It can also export the 'Active' orders (orders that have not been delted) in a backup file and also contains an Audit log of all the orders as well as
  log of all the orders ordered on a specifc day in a seprate file in the format Orders_MMDDYYYY.txt.

• Additional products and serviced tax-code areas can also be loaded in by adding them to the appropriate text files (e.g. Products.txt & Taxes.txt)
